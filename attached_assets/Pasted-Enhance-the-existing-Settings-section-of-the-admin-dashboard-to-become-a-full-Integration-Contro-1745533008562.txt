Enhance the existing "Settings" section of the admin dashboard to become a full **Integration Control Panel** for managing all external services and API keys. This panel should be modular, secure, and expandable.

📍 Page: `/admin/settings`

🧰 STRUCTURE:
Use tabbed sections or accordion panels for the following integration groups:

---

🛡️ TECH REQUIREMENTS:
- Store API keys in Replit Secrets or encrypted Firebase config
- Use environment variables in code (no keys hardcoded)
- Add visual confirmation when a key is saved or updated
- If any key is missing, disable its related features elsewhere in the app

🎨 UI Suggestions:
- Clean card or form-based layout
- Use badges/icons to show which service is active
- Inline validation + tooltip helper text for each field
