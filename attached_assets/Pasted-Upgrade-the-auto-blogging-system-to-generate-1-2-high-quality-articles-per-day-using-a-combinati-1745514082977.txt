Upgrade the auto-blogging system to generate **1–2 high-quality articles per day** using a combination of GPT-4 (OpenAI) and Gemini (Google) models. The system should produce **SEO-optimized, rank-ready articles** in the love and relationship niche that follow best search engine practices.

📌 PURPOSE:
Generate blog posts that can **rank fast on Google and Bing** by applying all major on-page SEO techniques and publishing them automatically. These articles must be relevant, valuable, and written in a style that appeals to women seeking relationship advice.

🧱 AI INTEGRATION:
- Use GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 for core writing
- Use Gemini to cross-check facts, suggest improvements, or enhance outline structure
- Combine outputs for maximum quality and relevance

📝 ARTICLE STRUCTURE & SEO REQUIREMENTS:

1. 📏 **Length**: 900 to 1400 words per post

   - **H3**: Supporting sub-points or psychology explanations
   - Bullet points and numbered lists when needed
   - End with a CTA block (e.g., “Try this free relationship quiz…”)

8. 📈 **Other SEO Enhancements**:

⚙️ SCHEDULING:

- Track which keywords have been used

💡 OPTIONAL:
