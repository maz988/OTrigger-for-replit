Build a full-stack web application called “Obsession Trigger AI” using the following stack and structure:

🧱 TECH STACK:
- Frontend: React (use Vite for fast setup)
- Backend: Firebase (Firestore for storage, Firebase Auth for optional login)
- AI Integration: OpenAI API (GPT-4 or GPT-3.5)
- PDF Generation: Use pdf-lib or jsPDF (on client side)
- Hosting: Replit deployment
- Email Storage: Save emails and quiz results to Firestore

🎯 PURPOSE:
This is a romantic relationship quiz tool targeted at women. After users complete a short 5-question quiz, the app uses AI to generate personalized advice based on their answers, compiles the advice into a branded downloadable PDF (with a soft affiliate pitch), and collects their name and email before download.

📋 QUIZ FLOW:
- Five multiple-choice or short-answer questions:
   1. What’s your relationship status?
   2. What’s your biggest concern in the relationship?
   3. What’s something he does that confuses you?
   4. How do you communicate with him?
   5. What’s your desired outcome?

🧠 AI LOGIC:
- After submission, send the answers to the OpenAI API.
- Prompt example:
  “Act as a women’s relationship expert. Based on these answers, give warm, intelligent advice that references emotional triggers, male psychology, and the Hero Instinct concept. End with a recommendation to explore this topic more deeply.”

📄 PDF OUTPUT:
- Title: “Your Custom Obsession Trigger Plan”
- 2-3 paragraphs of AI-written advice
- Footer includes this CTA:
  “To learn the full system that activates his Hero Instinct, download *His Secret Obsession*. Click here 👉 [your ClickBank affiliate link]”
- Offer download + open in browser option
- Make the PDF well-styled and branded (soft romantic colors)

📩 EMAIL COLLECTION:
- Before showing or downloading the PDF:
  - Ask for First Name and Email
  - Store in Firestore
  - Optional: confirm via modal or toast that it’s saved

💻 UI DESIGN:
- Modern, soft UI with elegant romantic feel
- Use soft pink, blue, and white colors
- Each quiz question appears as a card with smooth transitions
- Show a loading animation while generating AI result
- Display PDF preview in browser before download

🎯 BONUS:
- Include social share buttons after download
- Track quiz completions in Firestore (timestamp, email, status)

Set up the full environment with folders for:
- /components (QuizForm, ResultPage, PDFRenderer)
- /services (firebase.js, openai.js, pdfGenerator.js)
- .env for API keys
