Integrate a complete email capture and lead magnet delivery system into the Obsession Trigger AI project. The system should support multiple user-provided lead magnets and connect to a free email marketing tool for automation. Include a sidebar opt-in form on all blog pages and a funnel connected to quiz completions.

üì© PURPOSE:
Collect emails from women using relationship-focused lead magnets (PDFs provided by me), then automatically send value-based follow-up emails ‚Äî some purely helpful, others including affiliate offers.

üß± TECH STACK:
- Email delivery: Use a free email marketing platform like MailerLite, Brevo (Sendinblue), or ConvertKit (integrate via API or embed form)
- Frontend: React (or HTML/CSS if plain)
- Storage: PDFs hosted in /public or Firebase Storage

üì¶ LEAD MAGNET SYSTEM:
1. I will provide the lead magnet PDF files.
2. Users see opt-in form offering a free love guide.
3. Form collects:
   - First Name
   - Email
4. On submission:
   - Show success message
   - Save to Firestore or send to chosen ESP (MailerLite, etc.)
   - Show download link or automatically email the user the lead magnet
   - Track timestamp and opt-in source (quiz result, blog sidebar, etc.)

üß† NEWSLETTER FOLLOW-UP SYSTEM:
- Generate a series of 5 AI-powered follow-up emails using OpenAI (GPT-4 or 3.5):
   - Email 1: Warm welcome & relationship tip (no links)
   - Email 2: Psychology-based advice (e.g. male emotional needs)
   - Email 3: Practical love tip + invite to quiz
   - Email 4: Soft promo for *His Secret Obsession* (with my affiliate link)
   - Email 5: Emotional trust-building story + optional link
- Emails must sound empathetic, female-targeted, and intelligent

üñº SIDEBAR LEAD MAGNET OPT-IN:
- Add a reusable lead magnet form to all blog pages (sidebar on desktop, below content on mobile)
- Design: Soft, romantic UI with animated heart or glow on CTA
- Example CTA: ‚ÄúGet your Free Love Guide + Weekly Advice‚Äù
- Submission triggers the same funnel as quiz opt-in

üí¨ COMPONENTS TO BUILD:
- `/components/LeadMagnetForm.jsx` (main opt-in form)
- `/services/emailSignup.js` (handles Firestore save or ESP integration)
- `/public/leadmagnets/` (folder where I will upload my own PDFs)
- `/utils/emailTemplates.js` (generate AI follow-up content per subscriber)

üìå EXTRA:
- Prepare integration option for MailerLite or Brevo (I‚Äôll provide API key or embed if needed)
- Keep email and subscriber data portable for migration later

Make the system modular so I can reuse it on other pages (like pop-ups or exit-intent).

Let me know when you‚Äôre ready for my PDF files and affiliate link.
